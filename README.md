Partial, inaccurate, incomplete, unofficial, do not use for anything ever Juno 106 ROM disassemblies

The voice ROM is more disassembled than the assigner ROM. I don't think I'll ever make much sense of the assigner's tape routines.

There are a lot of bits of the code that demonstrate clearly why disassembly isn't always straightforward - it might be clear what is going on with the code but it's still a bit of a mystery *why*...

# Important
The code in the ROMs is almost certainly copyrighted. The information in these files is from my own decoding of the ROMs. If you do anything with this that gets you in trouble, that's your fault. If you break it, you own all the little pieces.
