# j106roms
Partial, inaccurate, incomplete, unofficial, do not use for anything ever Juno 106 ROM disassemblies

The voice ROM is more disassembled than the assigner ROM. I don't think I'll ever make much sense of the assigner's tape routines.

There are a lot of bits of the code that demonstrate clearly why disassembly isn't always straightforward - it might be clear what is going on with the code but it's still a bit of a mystery *why*...
